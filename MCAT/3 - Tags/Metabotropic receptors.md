Metabotropic receptors are membrane bound receptors that regulate cell activity by imitating metabolic processes. They are also known as G-protein coupled receptors. Their mechanism of action involves protein cascades that usually end up with upregulating something in the nucleus and the production of more long-term responses.

They activate second messengers such as cAMP and cGMP.
