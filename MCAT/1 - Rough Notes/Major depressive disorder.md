# Major depressive disorder

The neurotransmitter hypothesis of depression suggests that imbalances in dopamine, serotonin, and in certain cases norepi can be linked to major depressive disorder. Both serotonin and dopamine are necessary for regulating mood, and norepi is down because the sympathetic nervous system is less active.
