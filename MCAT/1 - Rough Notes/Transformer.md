# Transformer

A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another using electromagnetic induction, typically changing the voltage level by stepping it up or down.

A step-up transformer is one which consists of more secondary loops than primary loops. A step-down transformer has more primary loops than secondary loops.
