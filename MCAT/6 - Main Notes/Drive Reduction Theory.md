# Drive Reduction Theory

Developed by Clark Hull, drive reduction theory states that humans are motivated to satisfy physiological needs in order to maintain homeostasis. As drives build up, we are prompted to act in order to remove those drives.

According to Hull, drivel reduction is a major aspect of learning as well. Drives are thought to underlie all behavior in that behaviors are only conditioned, or learned if the reinforcement satisfies a drive.

Consider how hungry I get when I'm studying the MCAT and i'm stressed out. That internal drive of sudden, intense hunger makes me really want to get up and go grab the nearest food as quickly as possible(probably Slims!) to satisfy that drive.
