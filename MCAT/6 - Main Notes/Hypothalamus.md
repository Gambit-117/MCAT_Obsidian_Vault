# Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is a small region in the brain, located at the base of the brain, just below the thalamus and above the pituitary gland. It is part of the diencephalon.

The structure of the hypothalamus is divided into three main zones, the periventricular, medial, and lateral zones, and anterior, middle, and posterior regions.


### Hormonal control

The hypothalamus is often referred to as the body's "master regulator." It is a critical portion of the endocrine system, and it controls the release of many hormones. It also regulates body temperature, hunger and satiety, thirst and water balance, the sleep-wake cycle, emotional and behavioral responses, and reproductive functions.

The hypothalamus itself can make some hormones which are stored in the posterior pituitary, and it can signal the release of other hormones it has not created from the anterior pituitary. 

The hormones the hypothalamus itself makes and are stored in the posterior pituitary are [[oxytocin]] and [[Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)]]. The hormones that the hypothalamus releases to trigger a cascade from the anterior pituitary are [[growth hormone releasing factor (GHRH)]], [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)]], [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)]], [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)]], and [[Dopamine]].
