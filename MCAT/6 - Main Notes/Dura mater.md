# Dura mater

The dura mater is the outermost of the three meningeal membranes, which protect the brain. The dura mater is primarily derived from neural crest cells, with postnatal contributions from the paraxial mesoderm. 

The dura mater envelops the arachnoid mater, and it surrounds and supports the dural venous sinuses that reabsorb cerebrospinal fluid and carries the cerebral venous return back toward the heart.

The dura separates into two layers at dural reflections, also known as dural folds, where the inner dural layer is reflected as sheet-like protrusions into the cranial cavity. The falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli are the two main dural reflections. The falx cerebelli is another minor dural infolding.
