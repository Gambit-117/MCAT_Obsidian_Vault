# Heuristic

A heuristic is a mental shortcut that saves time when solving a problem.

Two common heuristics used in our lives are representativeness and availability heuristics. Representativeness heuristics are based off of understanding of a topic, such as a stereotype or prototype. An availability heuristic is based off experiencing an event.
