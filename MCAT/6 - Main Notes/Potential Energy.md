# Potential Energy

Potential energy is a measurement of the energy an object holds due its position or configuration. It can be measured in the context of a spring and gravity as follows:

$$ U = mgh $$
$$ U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 $$
where *k* is the spring constant. 

It is also possible to derive an equation to represent the gravitational potential energy between two masses in the context of Newtonian gravity:

$$ U = -\frac{GM_{1}m_{2}}{r} $$
Notably, the r is NOT squared in this equation.

Potential energy is measured with the SI unit of Joules.
