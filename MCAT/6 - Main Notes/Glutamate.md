# Glutamate

Glutamate is an amino acid that serves as a neurotransmitter in the brain and the spinal cord. It is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. It is used in long-term potentiation for learning and memories. It is also involved in brain development and sensory perception.

In the context of neurotransmitters, glutamate is metabolized from glutamine by mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase. In the neuron, it is packaged into synaptic vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). After undergoing exocytosis, glutamate is removed from the synaptic cleft by the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in glia and neurons. After being transported into glial cells by EAAT, glutamate is converted back into glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is then transported out of the glial cells by system N transporter 1 (SN1) and into nerve terminals by SAT2.

Two ionotropic glutamate receptors are well characterized, AMPA and NMDA. AMPA is used to bring in sodium ions, and NMDA is used to bring in calcium ions. There are also metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that cause slower postsynaptic responses that can either excite or inhibit postsynaptic cells.
