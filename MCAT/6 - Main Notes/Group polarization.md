# Group polarization

Group polarization is the phenomenon where individuals within a group will over time tend to form stronger, more extreme views, and their opinion can become more entrenched. This happens because group discussions can reinforce and amplify existing opinions, leading individuals to adopt more extreme positions.

Consider how the Christian community in the United States over time has grown more and more polarized and entrenched against the abortion movement.
