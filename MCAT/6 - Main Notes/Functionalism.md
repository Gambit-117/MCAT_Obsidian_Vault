# Functionalism

Functionalism is a framework for building theory that sees society as a complex system, whose institutions and parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. Functionalism focuses only on institutions and larger groups, not on the individual level.

The manifest function of institutions are the primary goals for outcomes or behaviors that are conscious and deliberate.

The latent function of institutions are the secondary functions that are accomplished by an outcome or behavior.
