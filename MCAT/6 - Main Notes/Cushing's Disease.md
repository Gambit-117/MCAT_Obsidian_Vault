# Cushing's Disease

Cushing's disease is a rare disorder that causes the body to produce too much cortisol. It can be caused by tumors in the anterior pituitary gland, which causes an excess in the production of ACTH.

Symptoms of Cushing's disease include a round, red face, excess fat between the shoulders, acne, weight gain, and many other issues.
