# Substantia Nigra

The substantia nigra is a small, dark-colored area of the brain located in the midbrain. It plays a crucial role in controlling movement, reward, and motivation. It contains dopamine-producing neurons that send projections to the basal ganglia. 

Damage to the substantia nigra can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Tourette's syndrome.
