# Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)

ACTH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland in response to stress or low levels of cortisol. It stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol, which help the body manage stress, inflammation, and metabolism. 

High ACTH levels may indicate Cushing's disease or a pituitary adenoma. Low ACTH levels may indicate Addison's disease or hypopituitarism.
