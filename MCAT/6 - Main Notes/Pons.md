# Pons

The pons is the part of the brainstem that coordinates movement, sensation, and sleep. It can also manage pain signals and connect the brainstem to the cerebellum and spinal cord.

The pons handles all unconscious movements and processes. These cycles include everything from sleeping to breathing, as well as head and facial nerves.
