# GABA

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter located in the brain. It is responsible for soothing and inhibiting neuronal activity, which helps maintain a harmonious balance in the overall brain function and the central nervous system. It has calming and relaxing effects, helping reduce stress, anxiety, and fear.

It has a close partner, glycine, which works in the spine and not the brain.

The predominant precursor for GABA synthesis is glucose, which is metabolized first to glutamate. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA with co-factor pyridoxal phosphate (B6). 

GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicles by vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). It is brought back into the neuron from glial cells or other neurons using GAT. 

The well-characterized GABA receptors are the ionotropic GABA_{A} and metabotropic GABA_{B} receptors. GABA_{A} allows for the influx of chlorine, and GABA_{B} activates potassium channels and blocks calcium channels. Influx of chlorine brings the RMP of the neuron down to be more negative, and activated potassium channels lets potassium escape and make the RMP more negative.
