# Oligodendrocytes

Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the CNS. They lay down a laminated, lipid-rich wrapping called myelin around some axons.

As oligodendrocytes wrap myelin sheaths around an axon, nodes of Ranvier are created in the spaces between the myelin sheaths.

Axons in the CNS that are myelinated by oligodendrocytes are able to conduct electrical charges faster and more efficiently than unmyelinated axons.
