# Occipital lobe

The occipital lobe is located at the back of the head, under the occipital bone. It is separated from the parietal lobe by the [[Parieto-occipital fissure]], and from the cerebellum by the [[Transverse fissure]].

The occipital lobe is responsible for visual processing, spatial reasoning, memory, object recognition, and language and reading.
