# Temporal Motivation Theory

Temporal motivation theory is a psychological theory that explains how people choose to act over time. It helps to explain why people procrastinate and how to motivate them to complete tasks by using goal-setting.

Consider how at the start of my MCAT prep, the exam feels further away, so my motivation might be lower than it is as I get closer and closer to the exam date and the pressure of my incoming doom begins to take deeper hold.
