# Resistivity

Electrical resistivity is the electrical resistance of a conductor of unit cross-sectional area and unit length. Resistivity is a fundamental part of resistance:
$$
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
$$
where rho is the constant of resistivity.

For conductors, the value for resistivity is always a small number * 10^-8. This is the justification for why we can ignore the resistance of the wires themselves, because it is very small.

The unit for the constant of resistivity is Ohms * m. 

For any given material, the resistivity increases with temperature:
$$
\rho_{T} = \rho_{0}[1+\alpha(T-T_{0})]
$$
