# Chronic Stressors

Chronic stressors relate to longer-term problems that are present over significant periods of time. For example, food, shelter, financial burdens, etc.

Stress is also linked to chronic increases in cortisol levels, which have a multitude of negative effects long-term. 

One of the most powerful chronic stressors are financial issues. People with a low socio-economic status are more likely to exhibit some issues similar to Cushing's-like symptoms and other results of elevated cortisol.
