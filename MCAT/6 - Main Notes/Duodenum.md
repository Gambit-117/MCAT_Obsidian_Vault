# Duodenum

The duodenum is a special segment of the small intestine which is present immediately after the stomach. The duodenum is the location in the small intestine where food is further digested, nutrients begin to be absorbed, and the pH is balanced by the release of many enzymes.

The duodenum is also notable for the release of CCK, a hormone which both aids in digestion and regulates appetite.

The duodenum opens up into the jejunum, which is the next section of the small intestine.
