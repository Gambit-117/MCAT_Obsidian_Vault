# Synaptic potentials

Synaptic potentials are electrical signals that are associated with communication between neurons at synaptic contacts. Synaptic potentials allow the transmission of information from one neuron to another in the complex neural circuits, like the CNS and PNS.

Activation of a synaptic terminal innervating a hippocampal pyramidal neuron causes a very brief change in the resting membrane potential in the pyramidal neuron.
