# Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are metabotropic receptors for acetylcholine that are found in virtually all organs and cell types. They are the most abundant ACh receptors in the brain, located in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. They can also be found in cardiac and smooth muscle tissue, secretory glands, and the eye.

In the parasympathetic nervous system, mAChRs control smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, slowing of the heart rate, and digestion regulation. In the sympathetic nervous system, mAChRs control sweat glands. 

mAChRs consist of 7 helical membrane-spanning domains and single binding sites on the extracellular surface deep in the channel. This causes a GPCR induced cascade that is slow and longer lasting. 5 different subtypes of mAChRs are known of.
