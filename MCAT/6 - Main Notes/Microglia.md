# Microglia

Microglial cells are the "macrophages" of the nervous system. They are derived from hematopoietic precursor cells, and are active at the site of neural injury and disease. They can engulf and remove cellular debris, dead neurons, and pathogens in the brain.

They share many of the properties of macrophages in other tissues, including the secretion of cytokines to modulate local inflammation and scavenging to remove cellular debris.
