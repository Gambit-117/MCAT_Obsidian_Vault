# Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the measurement of energy an object has due to its motion. It can be measured with:

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$
Kinetic energy can be related to work with the work-energy principle:

$$ W = \Delta KE $$

Kinetic energy can also be related to kinematics when trying to measure the velocity of an object when the force on it is not constant. Use the kinetic energy equation instead of kinematic equations.

Kinetic energy is measured in SI units with Joules.
