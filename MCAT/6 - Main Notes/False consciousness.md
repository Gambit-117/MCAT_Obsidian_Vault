# False consciousness

False consciousness is a condition in which the beliefs, ideals, or ideology of a person are not in the person's own best interest. It is a way of thinking that prevents a person from perceiving the true nature of their social or economic situation.

Consider that if you were to ask a person who makes $600k a year and a person who makes $50k a year what social class they were to fall into. Both might be tempted to say that they fall in the "middle class," despite the fact that their lifestyles and income are vastly different.

Consider if an individual from a disadvantaged group do not recognize the systemic reasons behind their struggles, such as the lack of ability to afford MCAT prep courses or tutoring, and instead attribute them to personal failure.
