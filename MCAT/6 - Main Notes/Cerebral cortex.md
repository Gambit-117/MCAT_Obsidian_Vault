# Cerebral cortex

The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain that controls many of its functions, including memory, thinking, and consciousness. It lies on top of the cerebrum. 

###### Plasticity
Studies have shown that the cerebral cortex has great plasticity in the event of digit loss. Regions of the cortex can demonstrate appreciable changes in cortical representation in response to physiological changes in sensory or motor experience.
