# Selective attention

Selective attention is the directed ability to focus on a task with background stimuli. Selective attention can be demonstrated through exogenous and endogenous clues. 

Exogenous clues are external stimuli that grab attention, like a car honking or a pleasant smell. 

Endogenous clues are learned, top-down cues such as recognizing your name at a cocktail party amidst conversation, or looking for a friend in a crowded room.
