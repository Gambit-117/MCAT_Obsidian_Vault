# Henderson-Hasselbach Equation

The Henderson-Hasselbach equation is the equation that allows for the calculation of pH based on the p of the equilibrium constant (pKa) and relative concentrations of a set of acids and bases. The equation is as follows:

$$
pH = pKa + \log\left( \frac{[A-]}{[HA]} \right)
$$

Where A- is the conjugate base, and HA is the acid.
