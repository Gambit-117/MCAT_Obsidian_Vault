# Needs

A need is a fundamental something required for a safe, stable, and healthy life. Needs are a psychological feature that arouses an organism to take action toward a goal, giving purpose and direction to behavior.

Internal factors motivate behavior based on unfulfilled needs.

Consider how I need food to live, or I need sleep to refresh my brain. Without food or sleep, i will not live very long, much less a safe, stable, or healthy life.
