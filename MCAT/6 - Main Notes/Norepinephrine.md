# Norepinephrine

Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that plays a vital role in the body's response to stress and other situations that require heightened alertness and focus. Norepi is released by the adrenal glands and the sympathetic nervous system in response to stress. It can also be released by a small group of neurons located in the brainstem in the locus coeruleus.

Norepi is classified as a catecholamines and a biogenic amine, used in the central nervous system and in the triggering of fight or flight.

Norepi is synthesized from tyrosine, which is turned into DOPA, which is turned into dopamine, which is turned into norepi. It is loaded into synaptic vesicles by VMAT, and when in the synaptic cleft it is cleared out by NET. Once back in the synaptic neuron, its levels can be controlled by MAO and COMT.
