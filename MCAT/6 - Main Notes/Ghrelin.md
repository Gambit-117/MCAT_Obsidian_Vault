# Ghrelin

Ghrelin is known as the "hunger" hormone in the stomach. Its main functions are to stimulate appetite and increase body weight. It is secreted from within the stomach, most notably in the [[Gastric Fundus]]. 

Ghrelin is often considered in combination with [[Leptin]], the "satiety" hormone.
