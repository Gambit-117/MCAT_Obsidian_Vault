# Synaptic facilitation

Synaptic facilitation is the rapid increase in synaptic strength that occurs when two or more action potentials invade the presynaptic terminal within a few milliseconds of each other.

Excess calcium will build up in the terminal, which will induce more neurotransmitter to be released. Synaptotagmin plays a major role in this by sensing the levels of calcium and inducing the release of neurotransmitters.
