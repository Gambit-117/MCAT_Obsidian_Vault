# Long-term depression

LTD is the prolonged process that weakens the connections between neurons. It is a type of synaptic plasticity that occurs in the brain's hippocampus and cerebellum.

LTD can be caused by low-frequency stimulation or inactivity in the synapses. 

LTD is well-characterized in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus.
