# Bipolar II

Bipolar II is a mental health condition characterized by alternating episodes of major depression and hypomania. It is distinct from bipolar I disorder, which involves full-blown manic episodes. 

Major depressive episodes include symptoms like persistent low mood or sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. Hypomanic episodes include symptoms like elevated mood or euphoria, increased energy and activity levels, decreased need for sleep, and grandiosity. However, the mania experienced in bipolar II is less intense than in bipolar I.
