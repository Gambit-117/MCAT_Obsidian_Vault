# Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

ADH is a hormone released by the hypothalamus that helps regulate water and salt levels in the blood, blood pressure, and kidney function. It also goes by the name "Vasopressin." 

When the hypothalamus notices that the blood is too salty or that the water concentration is too low, the posterior pituitary gland will release ADH. ADH will navigate to the collecting duct and increase the number of aquaporins. The collecting duct is in a very salty portion of the nephron, which means water will want to move out of the tubes and into the surrounding blood vessels.
