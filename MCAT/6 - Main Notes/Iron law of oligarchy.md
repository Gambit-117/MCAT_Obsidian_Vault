# Iron law of oligarchy

The iron law of oligarchy is a political theory which claims that rule by an elite is inevitable as an iron law within any democratic organization, given time. The tactical and technical necessities of organization dictate that eventually, more and more control will either be given or taken by less and less people in an organization.
