# Synaptic depression

Synaptic depression is the short-term decline in neurotransmitter release during sustained synaptic activity. It is caused by a progressive depletion in the pool of synaptic vesicles that are available for release.

More depression is observed after the size of the reserve pool is reduced by impaired levels of synapsin.
