# Material vs. symbolic culture

Material culture refers to those aspects of culture which are primarily physical and material. For example, a stethoscope is a tangible tool which represents the medical field.

Symbolic culture refers to those aspects of culture which are intangible, such as ideas, beliefs, and practices. For example, the Hippocratic Oath is a set of ethical guidelines which influences the culture of medicine.
