# Monoamine oxidase (MAO)

Monoamine oxidase plays a crucial role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, specifically monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

MAO catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamines, breaking them down into inactive compounds. There are two main types of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A is primarily responsible for the metabolism of serotonin, norepi, and epi. MAO-B is primarily responsible for the metabolism of dopamine and phenylethylamine.
