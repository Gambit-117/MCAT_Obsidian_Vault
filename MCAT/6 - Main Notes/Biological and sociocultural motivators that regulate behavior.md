# Biological and sociocultural motivators that regulate behavior

Biological and sociocultural factors can play a large part in motivation. Drive reduction theory suggests specifically that biological factors play a large part in our motivation, as we aim to maintain homeostasis.

The brain is the main center of which homeostasis is maintained. The hypothalamus acts as the primary control center for detecting changes in temperature and receiving input from the skin.

Specialized osmoreceptors in the brain detect dehydration and stimulate the release of ADH to raise blood pressure and prevent more fluid loss.

Hunger is regulated by hormones ghrelin and leptin.

Furthermore, as Maslow demonstrated, there are more than just these biological needs. There are also sociocultural factors as well, such as self-fulfillment, love and belonging, etc.
