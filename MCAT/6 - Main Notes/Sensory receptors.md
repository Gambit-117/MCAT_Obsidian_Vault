# Sensory receptors

All senses rely on specialized cells to detect the signals of various senses such as vision, hearing, pain, touch, smell, and more.

Broadly, sensory receptors are classified as one of four primary stimuli: chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors. 

Muscle spindles are a unique type of sensory receptor that are responsible for detecting the stretch of muscles.
