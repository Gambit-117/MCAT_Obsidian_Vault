# Collagen

Collagen is the primary building block of the body's skin, muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments. It is found in organs, blood vessels and intestinal linings. The main amino acids that make collagen are proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline. 

Collagen itself is a protein; it is not a cell.
