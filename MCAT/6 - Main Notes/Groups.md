# Groups

Groups are collections of people who identify and interact with one another and are united in some way.

A social group is two or more humans who interact with each other, share similar characteristics, and have a collective sense of unity. This is a broad definition that includes groups of all sizes.

Social groups can be divided into primary and secondary groups and in and out groups.

Dyads and triads are the smallest social groups. Interestingly, the triad is more stable than the dyad, mainly because one member can act as a mediator during times of conflict.
