# Cortisol

Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is responsible for managing body stress, blood pressure, and other vital functions, including blood pressure and glucose, immune function, inflammation, and metabolism. Chronic stress is linked to chronically elevated cortisol levels.

Starvation response is scenario when cortisol release is chronically elevated. This can cause symptoms such as increased hunger, blood sugar, fat deposition, tiredness, and decreased production of white blood cells.

Some research has shown that cortisol can cause decreases in memory as well.
