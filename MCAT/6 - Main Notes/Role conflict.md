# Role conflict

Role conflict is the phenomenon when two roles or statuses held by one individual are in conflict with one another. This can cause conflict, and often influences motivation to change it.

Consider in my own life: the role of a student and my burden of studying conflicted with my role as a grandson and my desire to celebrate my grandmother's 80th birthday or go to my late grandfather's funeral.
