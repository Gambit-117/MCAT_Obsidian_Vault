# Cardiomyocytes

Cardiomyocytes are the cells which make up the heart's muscle and are responsible for heart contraction. They are striated, branched cells that contain many mitochondria and a single nucleus.

In order to facilitate a quicker and more uniform contraction, cardiomyocytes are joined by gap junctions which connect their cytoplasm's together directly.
