# Deindividuation

Deindividualization refers to a psychological state where individuals in a group lose their sense of individual identity and personal responsibility, often leading to reduced self-awareness and decreased inhibitions. There is a tendency to lose yourself.

Some people posit that this happens as people experience a sense of anonymity. This concept is separate from obedience, conformity, or compliance.
