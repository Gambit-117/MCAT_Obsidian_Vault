# Faraday's Law

Faraday's law is a law of electromagnetism that uses the concept of magnetic flux to allow the prediction of the induced emf due to the relative motion between the charges in a conducting loop and the external field. It can be measured with:
$$
\mathcal{E} = \left|\frac{\Delta \displaystyle \Phi_{B}}{\Delta t} \right|
$$
where $\Phi_{B}$ is the magnetic flux, and $t$ is the change in time.

Since:
$$
\Phi_{B} = AB\cos(\theta)
$$
We can change the magnetic flux in three different ways:
1. Change the strength in the field of the loop, B
2. Change the size of the loop, A
3. Change orientation of the loop in the field, $\theta$



It is possible to use the equation:
$$
\mathcal{E} = B\ell v
$$
when only the area is changing in a particular direction.
