# Common Bile Duct

The common bile duct is a tube which carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. It is the portion of the [[biliary system]] which is found after the [[cystic duct]] and [[common hepatic duct]] merge.

The common bile duct can also allow the pancreas to add bicarbonate and proteins such as amylase, maltase, lactase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and others to help break down lipids, carbs, and proteins and balance the pH levels.
