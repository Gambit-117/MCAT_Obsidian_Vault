# Out-group

An out-group is a group that one does not belong to or identify with. 

Out-groups can become victim to out-group homogeneity, which is a cognitive bias where people perceive members of an out-group as more similar than they actually are.

In other words, **"They're all the same, but we're all unique"**

Consider how I might see members of my cybersecurity group versus software engineers. I might see other cybersecurity people in my in-group as a diverse group with different skill sets, but when looking at software engineers who don't focus on security, I might just think of them all as just "general programmers" and overlook their differences in specialties.
