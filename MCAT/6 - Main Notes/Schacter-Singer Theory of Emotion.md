# Schacter-Singer Theory of Emotion

Schacter-Singer theory of emotion states that a stimulus will trigger a physiological change, which will lead to a cognitive appraisal before leading to an emotion.

Consider riding a roller coaster and having your heart rate go up, but you do not fear for your life because you trust in the ride not to collapse.
