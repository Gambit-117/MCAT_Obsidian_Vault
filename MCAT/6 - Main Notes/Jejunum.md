# Jejunum

The jejunum is the second major section of the small intestine. It is preceded by the duodenum and followed by the ileum. The jejunum is mainly characterized by the reabsorption of nutrients from food as it passes through.

The jejunum is distinct from the ileum due to its circular folds and extra intestinal villi, increasing surface area.
