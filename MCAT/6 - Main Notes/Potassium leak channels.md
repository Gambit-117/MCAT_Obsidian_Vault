# Potassium leak channels

Potassium leak channels are membrane bound proteins that allow potassium ions to pass through the cell membrane, controlling the excitability of nerves and the heart by increasing the cell membrane's permeability to potassium.

They are responsible for pain signaling, resting membrane potential, and neuromuscular function. They can be regulated by signaling lipids, oxygen tension, pH, mechanical stretch, and G-proteins.
