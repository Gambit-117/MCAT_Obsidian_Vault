# Cyclothymia

Cyclothymia is a chronic mood disorder characterized by numerous periods of hypomania and depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for bipolar disorder.

Symptoms of hypomania include elevated mood or euphoria, increased energy and activity levels, decreased need for sleep, and grandiosity. Symptoms of depression include persistent low mood or sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. Any of these symptoms experienced are less intense than those in bipolar I or bipolar II.
