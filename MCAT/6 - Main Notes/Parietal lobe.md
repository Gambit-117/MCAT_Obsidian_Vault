# Parietal lobe

The parietal lobe is located at the top and back of the head. It is separated from the frontal lobe by the [[Central sulcus]], from the occipital lobe by the [[Parieto-occipital fissure]], and from the temporal lobe by the [[lateral sulcus]]. 

The parietal lobe functions to process sensory information, including touch, pain, temperature, and joint position.
