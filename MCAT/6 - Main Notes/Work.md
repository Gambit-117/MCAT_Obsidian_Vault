# Work

Work is the measure of the transfer of energy when a force is applied over a displacement. If an object has positive work, the component is moving in the direction of displacement. If an object has negative work, it is opposing the displacement. The formula is as follows:

$$ W = Fd\cos(\theta) $$
where *d* is the displacement of the object and theta is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector. The answer is measured in joules.

The work-energy principle states that work is also related to the changes in kinetic energy:

$$ W = \Delta KE $$
