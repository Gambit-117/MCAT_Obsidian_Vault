# Calcium pumps

Calcium pumps are important proteins that are responsible for removing Ca2+ from cells and back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. They are regulated by kinases and calpain. 

There are multiple different types of Ca2+ pumps:
1. PMCA (plasma membrane)
2. SERCA (store Ca2+ in the ER)
3. SPCA (secretory pathways)

Calcium needs to be removed from the neuron because it the main secondary messenger that signals for the release of neurotransmitters.
