# Divided attention

Divided attention, also known as multitasking, is the attempt to perform two or more tasks simultaneously. It relies on one's cognitive load, or the total amount of mental effort being used in working memory.

Multitasking is easier to accomplish when the tasks being attempted are dissimilar. Consider how I listen to Dr. John Piper's messages or Pastor Leaman's messages while I'm doing laundry or cooking. It also helps when certain tasks do not stress the cognitive load, such as walking or jogging where little effort is needed to perform that task successfully.
