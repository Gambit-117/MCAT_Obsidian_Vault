# Acute Stressors

Acute stressors are short-term events that cause stress. They can be real or imagined, or physical, emotional, or phycological.

Cortisol is the primary stress hormone, which will likely be elevated in states of acute stress. In order to regulate the production of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) must first be released by the pituitary gland. In order to release ACTH, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) must first be released by the hypothalamus. Depending on how immense the stressor is, the sympathetic nervous system may be kicked in, releasing epi/norepi.
