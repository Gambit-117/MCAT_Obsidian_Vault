# Angiotensin

Angiotensin is a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance in the kidney. 

In the signaling cascade in the kidney, angiotensin is released after renin. Angiotensin I travels to the lungs where it interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II will cause more downstream effects, such as the activation of aldosterone.
