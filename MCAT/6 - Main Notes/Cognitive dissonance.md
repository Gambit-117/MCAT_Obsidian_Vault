# Cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when an individual experiences discomfort or tension as a result of holding contradictory beliefs or attitude, or when their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs or values. Resolving cognitive dissonance typically involves making changes in cognition, beliefs, or actions to reduce this psychological discomfort.

Repeating the same action, especially if it is inconsistent with one's beliefs, tends to exacerbate cognitive dissonance rather than relieve it.

In the context of motivation, people are proposed to have a motivational desire to reduce dissonance in their cognitions by doing something: either changing or justifying their attitudes.
