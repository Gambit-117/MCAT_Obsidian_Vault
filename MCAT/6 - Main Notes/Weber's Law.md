# Weber's Law

Weber's law states that the difference threshold is proportional to the magnitude of a stimulus. This can be represented in mathematical form by the following relationship:

$$
\frac{\Delta I}{I} = k
$$

Consider in my own life how I am easily startled by a loud gunshot when I'm sitting at home studying versus when I'm at the gun range.
