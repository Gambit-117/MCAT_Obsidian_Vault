# Digestion in the Mouth

The mouth is a site of both chemical and physical digestion. [[Salivary Amylase]] and [[lingual lipase]] are both present to digest [[Carbohydrates]] and [[Lipids]], alongside the obvious chewing actions. 

This means that proteins do not experience any form of digestion in the mouth, save that which is provided by chewing.
