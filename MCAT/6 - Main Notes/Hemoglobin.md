# Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin is a critical protein inside red blood cells that is responsible for transporting oxygen to the tissues. Hemoglobin is made up of 4 [[Heme Groups]] and other globular proteins. 

Hemoglobin has unique properties when exposed to changes in pH. Under low pH conditions, such as when exercising or holding the breath for an extended period of time, hemoglobin becomes worse at holding onto molecular oxygen. While this does cause hemoglobin to pick up less oxygen from the lungs, it causes a more significant change in the amount of release of oxygen in tissues. This is referred to as the [[Bohr Shift]].
