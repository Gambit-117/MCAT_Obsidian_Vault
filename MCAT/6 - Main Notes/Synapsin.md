# Synapsin

Synapsin is a family of proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release in the brain and central nervous system. They function by binding to synaptic vesicles and the actin cytoskeleton to regulate the docking and release of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitters. 

There are 3 types of synapsin:
- Synapsin I
- Synapsin II
- Synapsin III

Mutations in synapsin I have been linked to epilepsy and X-linked learning disabilities, and mutations in synapsin II and III have been implicated in schizophrenia.
