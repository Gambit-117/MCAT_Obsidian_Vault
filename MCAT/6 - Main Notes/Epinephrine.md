# Epinephrine

Epi is a neurotransmitter and a hormone that plays an important role in the body's fight-or-flight response. It can also be used as a medication to treat many life-threatening conditions.

Epi is produced in the adrenal glands and can also be released from neurons. Epi is derived from tyrosine, which is converted to DOPA, which is then converted to dopamine, which is then converted to norepinephrine, which is then converted to epi. It is loaded into synaptic vesicles by VMAT, and it can be cleared out of the synaptic cleft by NET.

Epi can bind to both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.
