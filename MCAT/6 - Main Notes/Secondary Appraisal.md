# Secondary Appraisal

A secondary appraisal is a person's interpretation of the resources available to themselves to deal with a perceived stressor. It suggests that individuals who believe they have adequate resources to handle a stressor will likely experience fewer negative emotions and employ more effective coping strategies.
