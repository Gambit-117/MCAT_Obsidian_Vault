# Acetylcholine

Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter that carries signals in both the sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system, and it is a significant component of the autonomic nervous system. It is a chemical messenger which transmits signals between neurons and other cells in the body. 

Acetylcholine's main functions include memory, movement, and alertness. In the parasympathetic nervous system, acetylcholine controls rest, digest, and urination by binding to receptors on cells and causing muscle contractions.

Acetylcholine is used by motor neurons to initiate muscle contraction by binding to receptors on muscle cell membranes. Motor neurons will release ACh into the synaptic space at the neuromuscular junction. ACh will bind to nicotinic receptors on the muscle cell membrane, which allows sodium ions to flow into the muscle cell, depolarizing the membrane. This generates action potential, causing it to contract.

Acetylcholine is synthesized in nerve terminals from the precursors acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl CoA) and choline in a reaction catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase. It is loaded into vesicles by vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT). After release, it is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the synaptic cleft.

Ach receptors include ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. The metabotropic receptors include muscarinic ACh recpetors (mAChRs) and nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs).

Within the visceral motor system, Ach is the primary neurotransmitter for both sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons.
