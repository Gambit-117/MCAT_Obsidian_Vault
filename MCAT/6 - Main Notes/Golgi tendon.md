# Golgi tendon

Golgi tendons are mechanoreceptors formed by branches of group Ib afferents distributed among the collagen fibers that form the tendons. Golgi tendon organs are arranged in series with a small number (10-20) of extrafusal muscle fibers. They are used to detect changes in the tension of a muscle.
