# Social capital

Social capital is the network of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively. It involves who you know.

Consider that being the son of a peripheral nerve surgeon I was able to get connected with prominent and exclusive doctor, Dr. Higgins, who I was able to get both medical care from and shadowing hours with.

A higher socioeconomic status can certainly affect the amount and quality of social capital a person can generate.
