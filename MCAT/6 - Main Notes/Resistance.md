# Resistance

Resistance is the ratio of voltage to current for any element in a circuit. 

Resistance can be found using Ohm's Law:
$$
V = IR
$$
	*Twinkle twinkle little star... V is equal to IR...*

where *V* is the voltage across the element, *I* is the current, and *R* is the resistance of the element. The unit of resistance is the Ohm.

Resistors that are in series continue to add resistance to the circuit.
$$
R_{equivalent} = R_{1} + R_{2} + \dots
$$

Resistors that are in parallel behave differently. Each resistor in a circuit has the full voltage, which means the total resistance in a parallel circuit is equal to the sum of the inverse of each individual resistance.
$$
\frac{1}{R_{equivalent}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \dots
$$

The resistance of a wire can be found with the following equation:
$$
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
$$
where rho is the resistivity, a constant characteristic of the metal in question.

Resistors themselves do not have any native polarity. The only thing that relates to the polarity of the resistor is the assumed direction of the current through the resistor.
