# Piaget's stages of cognitive development

Piaget developed a theory for cognitive development from a psychoanalytical perspective. The key ages in this are ages 2, 7, 12, or additions of 5 starting from 2.

*SPCF* : (2, 7, 12)

*One is a bun, two is a shoe, three is a tree, and four is a door*
*1. two ants on a motorcycle with buns for wheels*
*2. goofy shoes on a magician with a rabbit coming out of a hat, or on smokey the bear*
*3. a tree with concrete leaves*
*4. four males with crazy ripped abs*

The *sensorimotor stage* is from ages 0-2, where infants develop object permanence and separation anxiety.

The *preoperational stage* is from 2-6, where children develop egocentrism, pretending, and centration.

The *concrete operational* stage is from 7-12, where children develop in conversation, logic, and math.
 
The *formal operational* stage is from 12 onward, where teens begin to develop abstract reason and hypothetical analysis.
