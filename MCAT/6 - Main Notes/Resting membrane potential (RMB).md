# Resting membrane potential (RMB)

The resting membrane potential of a neuron is maintained by a separation of charges which can move down their electrochemical gradient due to voltage-gated channels.

The electrical potential different across the neuron's cell membrane is the result of selective permeability to charged ions, which is accomplished and maintained by ion pumps in the membrane of the neuron, specifically sodium potassium pumps and chloride pumps. 

The RMB is -70 mV in a normal cell because the potassium plays the biggest role and has the most influence. The potassium that leaks from the inside of the cell to the outside via leak potassium channels helps generate the negative charge in the inside of the membrane vs the outside. At rest, the membrane is impermeable to sodium as all of the sodium channels are closed.
