# Role strain

Role strain is the phenomenon where one person experiences stress or strain when incompatible behavior, expectations, or obligations are associated with a single social role. It is related to an individual which is having trouble fulfilling a role.

The key to role strain is that this is associated with a *single* role, and not multiple.

Consider in my life, the role of being a student. I have role strain when I have trouble fulfilling my role as a student when the biomedical science coursework and the MCAT studies overlap, which both are significant time commitments.
