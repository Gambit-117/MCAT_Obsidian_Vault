# Adrenal Gland

The adrenal glands are a pair of small, triangular glands located on top of each kidney. They produce hormones that regulate many important body functions, including blood pressure, metabolism, and stress response.

The adrenal gland is broken up into two sections, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. The cortex is the outer portion, and the medulla is the inner portion of the gland. In the adrenal cortex, aldosterone and cortisol are created, along with other hormones related to both. In the medulla, epi and norepi are created and released.
