# Long-term potentiation

Long-term potentiation is the long-lasting increase in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. It is a key part of the brain's ability to learn and form memories.

LTP is shown with persistent increases in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron. All of the focus of LTP is in the postsynaptic neuron, and not in the presynaptic neuron. 

The mechanism of LTP is believed to focus on the strength of glutamate reception in postsynaptic neurons. When weak, low frequency synaptic transmissions are continually expressed, it is believed that only AMPA can open, which lets in sodium but not any calcium since NMDA cannot overcome the magnesium block within the channel. However, when the sum of EPSP's reaches a large, strong expression, prolonged depolarization is enough to remove the magnesium block from NMDA channels, which allows the influx of calcium as a secondary messenger and causing LTP.

LTP is well-characterized in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus.
