# Bottom-up processing

Bottom-up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input. This means that we assess what we see, hear, taste, smell, or touch in order to make sense of something. 

Consider if you're trying to read a friend's messy handwriting. If you can't read the words, you need to resort to the immediate processing of the lines, curves, and shapes of the letters to piece together the words.
