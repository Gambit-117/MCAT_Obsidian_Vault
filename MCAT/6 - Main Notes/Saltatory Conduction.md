# Saltatory Conduction

Saltatory conduction is the process by which action potentials are quickly and efficiently moved along myelinated axons. It begins in nerves that are myelinated, either by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells. When an action potential is generated, the myelin sheaths increase the resistance between the membrane and the inside of the nerve, preventing ions from escaping the cell. Myelination also decreases the resistance internal to the nerve by increasing the diameter of the inside of the nerve. This in turn increases the current and speeds up the signal transduction. Nodes of Ranvier help propagate this signal by continually depolarizing the membrane every so often between myelin sheaths.
