# Clotting Cascade

Clotting involves a coagulation cascade with a handful of hormones and platelets. First, prothrombin is converted to thrombin, which turns blood soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin. This causes the fibrin to bind to the platelets which pack together to form a clot and stop the bleeding.
