# Bohr Shift

The Bohr shift is a natural phenomenon that occurs when hemoglobin is exposed to changes in pH in the environment. As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases or decreases, hemoglobin's affinity to oxygen will either decrease or increase accordingly. 

One interesting method to induce the Bohr shift naturally is to breathe more quickly or more slowly. As you breathe quicker, the amount of CO2 exiting your body will be greater, shifting the [[Carbonic Acid Buffer System]] further to the left, which makes the blood more alkaline. As you breathe slower, a shift to the right makes the blood more acidic.
