# Voltage

Voltage, otherwise known as electrical chemical difference, is a measure of the difference in electrical potential that is caused by a separation of charge. Voltage sources create a potential difference and can supply a current if connected to a resistance.

The formula to find the electric potential of a point charge is as follows:

$$
V = k\frac{Q}{r}
$$
where *k* is a constant (9 * 10^9), *Q* is the charge of the particle being considered, and *r* is the distance from the particle in question.
