# Heme Groups

A Heme group is a a prosthetic group that is made up of a protoporphyrin ring and an iron atom. Heme is a critical *cofactor* for the protein [[Hemoglobin]], a critical protein in the blood that is responsible for oxygenating all the tissues in your body, which is carried out by the Respiratory System.

An important consideration to note about Heme is that it is **NOT** a protein itself; it is a cofactor. It is not made up of polypeptides; it is simply a non-living chemical structure that is necessary for the protein hemoglobin to function.
