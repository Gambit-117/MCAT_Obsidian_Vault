# Arachnoid mater

The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, that lies directly below the dura mater and above the pia mater. It is a thin, web-like membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord.

It's primary function is to create the subarachnoid space, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which provides cushioning and support for the central nervous system while allowing for CSF circulation through projections called arachnoid villi.
