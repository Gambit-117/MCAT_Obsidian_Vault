# Bureaucracy

A bureaucracy is one type of formal organization, and it has a particular focus on efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish the goals of the organization. 

The characteristics of an ideal bureaucracy include the following five concepts as defined by Max Weber:
- Division of labor
- Hierarchy of authority
- Framework of rules
- Impersonality
- Formal selection

The iron law of oligarchy would claim that over time, the bureaucracy will slowly become more like an oligarchy, with one person in charge.
