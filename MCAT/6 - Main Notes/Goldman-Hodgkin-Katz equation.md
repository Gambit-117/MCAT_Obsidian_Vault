# Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

The GHK equation, also known as the Goldman equation, is used to find the resting membrane potential of a neuron, which involves the permeability of the membrane to multiple ions. It is not used to find the permeability of the cell to one type of ion; that is the Nernst equation.

The GHK equation is as follows:

$$
V = 61.5 \log \frac{P_{k}[K]_{o} + P_{Na}[Na]_{o}+P_{Cl}[Cl]_{i}}{P_{k}[K]_{i} + P_{Na}[Na]_{i}+P_{Cl}[Cl]_{o}}
$$
The membrane potential is affected by the relative permeability to each ion. If the permeability to a certain ion increases, the membrane potential moves closer to the equilibrium potential for that ion (and vice versa).
