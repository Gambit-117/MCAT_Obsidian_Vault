# Bowman's capsule

Bowman's capsule is a cup-shaped structure in the kidney that surrounds the glomerulus, a network of tiny blood vessels. Bowman's capsule is found in the renal corpuscle, which is located in the cortex of the kidney. 

Bowman's capsule is made up of two layers of epithelial cells, the parietal layer and the visceral layer. The parietal layer is the outer layer, which forms the cup-like shape of the capsule. The visceral layer is the inner layer, which covers the glomerulus.
