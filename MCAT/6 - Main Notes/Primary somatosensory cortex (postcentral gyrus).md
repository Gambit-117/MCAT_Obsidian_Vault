# Primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus)

The postcentral gyrus is a region of the brain located on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe that processes sensory information from the body, including touch, pressure, temperature and pain. It is also responsible for proprioception and vestibular information.

Tumors or damage to the postcentral gyrus will cause issues related to pain, such as numbness and tingling.
