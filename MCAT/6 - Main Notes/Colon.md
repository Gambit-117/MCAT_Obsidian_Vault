# Colon

The colon is most notably responsible for the absorption of water and salt, which helps solidify stool and maintain fluid balance in the body.

The colon consists of four major portions: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. It is directly connected to the appendix, the rectum, and the anus.
