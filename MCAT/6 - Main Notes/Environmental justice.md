# Environmental justice

Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

Wealthier areas tend to enjoy environmental benefits, like parks, bike paths, and other green spaces, while areas of high poverty are more likely to struggle with environmental burdens.
