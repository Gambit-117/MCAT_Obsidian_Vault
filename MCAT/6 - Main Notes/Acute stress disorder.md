# Acute stress disorder

Acute stress disorder is a temporary mental health condition that develops in the first month after experiencing a traumatic event. It is characterized by intense and distressing symptoms that interfere with daily functioning.

Symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event through flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive thoughts, avoidance of reminders of the event, dissociation, increased arousal, and overall negative changes in mood. ASD can trigger the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. The amygdala and the prefrontal cortexes of the brain are also overactive in fear processing.

ASD is similar to PTSD, but ASD symptoms occur within the first month after a traumatic event, while PTSD symptoms last longer than one month.
