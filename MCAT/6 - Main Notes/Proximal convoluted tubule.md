# Proximal convoluted tubule

The proximal convoluted tubule is the first windy section of the nephron, immediately after the glomerulus. It is an area of high metabolic activity where "treasures" that managed to sneak through the glomerulus are sorted out and pumped back into circulation, while other un-necessary things are allowed to continue through.

Many things are pumped out of the nephron in this area.
