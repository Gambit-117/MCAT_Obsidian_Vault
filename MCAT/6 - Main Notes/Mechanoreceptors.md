# Mechanoreceptors

Mechanoreceptors are sensory neurons that detect mechanical pressure and distortion. They are found in the skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules.

Mechanoreceptors convert mechanical pressure into electrical signals that are sent to the central nervous system. They generate graded, receptor potentials.
