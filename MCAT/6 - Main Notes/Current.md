# Current

Current is the rate of flow of charge through a conductor per unit time. The formula for capacitance is as follows:

$$
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
Where *Q* is charge, and *t* is time. The SI unit for current is the ampere, which is the same as C/s.

Voltage provides the electromotive force which causes the electrons to move and create a current.
