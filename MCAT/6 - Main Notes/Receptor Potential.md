# Receptor Potential

Receptor potentials, also known as generator potentials, are local, non-propagated responses that can occur in some sensory receptors where mechanical energy is converted into electrical signals.

They are graded, meaning the larger the stimulus the larger the depolarization, and they are additive, meaning small stimuli close together in time will produce greater and greater stimuli.

Receptor potentials occur most often in sensory receptors located in specialized organs like the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin.
