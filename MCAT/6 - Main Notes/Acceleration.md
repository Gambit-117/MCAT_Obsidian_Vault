# Acceleration

Acceleration measures how quickly and object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction. Simply measured, it can be found as follows:

$$ a = \frac{\Delta_x}{\Delta t} $$
It can also be related to rotational motion:

$$ a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r} $$
Which in turn can also be related to Newton's second law to calculate the centrifugal force:

$$ F_{c} = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$

Acceleration is measured in units of *m/s^2*
