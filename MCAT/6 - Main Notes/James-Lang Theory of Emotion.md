# James Lang Theory of Emotion

The James Lang theory states that a stimulus causes an physiological change, which induces an emotion.

Notably, this theory is the only theory that would outright say that a stimulus which produces a given response will **always** produce an emotion tied with it. 

	Example: Little Billy is stung by a bee for the 80th time this month. He is allergic. He comes in and I give him an epinephrine shot. He isn't afraid of needles and knows it will help him. Will the shot cause fear under the J-L theory?

	Answer: Yes. Under the J-L Theory of emotion, he should feel fear because the stimulus of the shot of epi will induce the physiological change of the sympathetic activation, which will produce the emotion of fear.
