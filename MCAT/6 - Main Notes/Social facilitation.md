# Social facilitation

Social facilitation is the phenomenon where the presence of an audience or others enhances the ability of an individual to perform on a task they are already skilled at. This is the opposite of social loafing.

Yerkes-Dodson law can also be applied to social facilitation, which would demonstrate that just having people around will enhance the performance in speed and accuracy of well-practiced tasks, but will degrade in the performance of less familiar tasks.
