# Status

Status refers to one's standing in the community and his position in the social hierarchy. Social status refers to the honor or prestige, a measure of how good the reputation of something or someone is, attached to one's position in society.

*Achieved status* is the status one earns through their own personal achievements. Consider the status a doctor holds after years of work to become a doctor.

*Ascribed status* the statue one is given based on their position in the social hierarchy. Consider the status a child of a monarch holds because of their family name.

Social stratification is a system by which society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy.
