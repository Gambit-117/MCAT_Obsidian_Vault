# Sensation

Sensation refers to our ability to detect or sense the physical qualities of our environment. A sensory threshold is the point at which a stimulus causes a sensation within an individual; below this threshold, there will be no sensation.

The most important sensory threshold is the absolute threshold, which is the smallest detectable level of stimulus. Every sense of the body has some absolute threshold.

The minimum amount of change in sensory stimulation needed to recognize that a change has occurred is known as the difference threshold, or the just-noticeable difference (JND). 

Sensory adaptation happens when our senses no longer perceive a stimulus because of our sensory receptor's continuous contact with it.

Sensory interaction can also occur, in which one sensory modality affects another (for example, needing to turn down the music in the car so you can see the street signs better)

Two other important aspects of sensation are signal detection theory and Weber's Law.
