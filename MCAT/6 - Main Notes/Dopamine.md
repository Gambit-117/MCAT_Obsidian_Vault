# Dopamine

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger in the brain, that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. It is used in reward and pleasure pathways and plays a large role in motivation, focus, and movement. Low levels can also contribute to depression and anxiety.

Dopamine is synthesized in a pathway starting with tyrosine, and going through the intermediate DOPA. It is transported into a synaptic vesicle by VMAT. Dopamine is then cleared out of the synaptic cleft by DAT back into the presynaptic neuron. Dopamine levels are controlled and broken down by monoamine oxidase (MAO), and COMT.
