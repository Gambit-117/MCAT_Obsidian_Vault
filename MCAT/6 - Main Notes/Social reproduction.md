# Social reproduction

Social reproduction is the phenomenon that the structures, activities, views, and status of a parent generation are more likely to be shown in their child generation as well. Social reproduction refers to how social inequality can be transmitted from one generation to the next.

Social reproduction revolves around the understanding that the rich breed rich, and the poor breed poor.

Consider how a child from a poor family might not be able to afford tutors, prep courses or college tuition; those disadvantages are more likely to be passed down to his children.
