# Glycine (Gly)

Glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter located in the spine. It is responsible for inhibiting or reducing neuronal activity and contributing to the stability of spinal cord function. Half of the inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord use glycine.

It has a close partner, GABA, which is in the brain and not the spine.

Glycine is synthesized from serine by the mitochondrial isoform of serine hydroxy-methyltransferase. It is packaged into synaptic vesicles by VIAAT, and it is removed from the synaptic cleft by glycine transporters.

Ionotropic glycine receptors are ligand-gated chlorine channels, that allow chlorine to enter the cell and make it more negative.
