# Yerkes-Dodson Law

The Yerkes-Dodson law is a concept which suggests performance level reaches its peak when there's a moderate level of arousal or stress. Too little stress will cause fatigue and sleepiness, inhibiting performance, and too much stress will produce anxiety and impaired performance. Optimal levels of performance will occur at moderate levels of arousal.

Simple tasks will not experience any loss in proficiency at high levels of arousal, but difficult tasks will. At very low arousal, difficult tasks will also have a decreased level of performance.
