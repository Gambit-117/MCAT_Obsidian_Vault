# Capacitance

Capacitance is defined as the amount of charge that can be stored at a given voltage by an electrical component called a capacitor. There are two formulas for capacitance.

$$
C = \frac{Q}{V}
$$
where *Q* is the charge stored, and where *V* is the voltage across the capacitor. The unit for capacitance is the Farad.

Capacitance is a constant that is created by the area of the plates on the capacitor and the distance between them.

$$
C = k\varepsilon_{o}\frac{A}{d}
$$
where *k* is the dielectric constant of the material, *e0* is the permittivity of free space, *A* is the area of the plates, and *d* is the distance between the two plates.

The potential energy within a capacitor can be found using the following formula:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
$$
where *Q* is the charge,  is *V* the voltage, and *C* is the capacitance.
