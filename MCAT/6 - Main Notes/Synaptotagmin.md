# Synaptotagmin

Synaptotagmin is a protein that plays a major part in synaptic vesicles in neurons. It is a direct calcium sensor that plays a key role in the fusion of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane during exocytosis, which releases neurotransmitters.

Synaptotagmin is a membrane protein with a transmembrane region, a linker, and two C2 domains.
