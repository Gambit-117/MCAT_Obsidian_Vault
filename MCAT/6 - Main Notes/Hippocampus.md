# Hippocampus

The hippocampus is an area of the brain that integrates emotional experience with cognition.

Some tying of emotion to cognition and memory is important, since it reinforces experiences to make sure you either avoid them more or seek them out more. For example, remembering the location of a food in the wilderness is important to remember. This can also play a large role in addiction as well.
