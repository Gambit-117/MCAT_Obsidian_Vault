# Newton's Second Law

Newton's second law describes the relationship between the net force acting on an object, its mass, and its acceleration. It is one of the foundational principles of classical mechanics. It is written as follows:
$$ F_{net} = ma $$
The ending result is a force with a unit of Newtons (N), which can be broken down as the following SI units:
$$ Newton = kg * m/ s^2 $$
