# Hooke's Law

Hooke's Law describes the behavior or ideal springs, or any system that exhibits elastic behavior. The it relates the force applied to a spring and the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position:

$$ F = -kx $$
where *k* is the spring constant and *x* is the distance in meters. The force is measured in the SI unit of Newtons.
