# Projectile Motion

Projectile motion analysis requires the consideration of the x and y vector components of an object that was launched at an angle. The x and y components can be measured as follows:

$$ v_{x} = v_{0}\cos(\theta) $$
$$v_{y} = v_{0}\sin(\theta) $$
For the rest of the calculations, the standard kinematic equations can be used on each vector component in question.
