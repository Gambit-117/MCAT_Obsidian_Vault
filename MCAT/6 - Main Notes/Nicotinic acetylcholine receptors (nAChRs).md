# Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)

Nictonic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are proteins that respond to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and drugs like nicotine. They are found in the nervous system, muscle, and other tissues. They are the primary ionotropic receptor for ACh in the body. Because ACh is an excitatory neurotransmitter, nAChRs allow sodium to enter the cell, which depolarizes the cell and makes it more likely to transmit an action potential.
