# Sulcus limitans

The sulcus limitans within the brainstem is a groove that separates the cranial nerve motor nuclei from the sensory nuclei, demarcating the dorsal plate from the ventral plate. It is used as a reference point for identifying and locating brainstem structures during surgery or imaging studies.
