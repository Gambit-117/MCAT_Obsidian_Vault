# Torque

Torque is a measure of the force of an object applied at an angle which causes rotational motion. The equation for torque is as follows:

$$ \tau = rF\sin(\theta) $$
where *r* is the length of the lever arm, *F* is the force applied in newtons, and theta is the angle between the lever arm and the line of action of the force. The answer is in the SI unit of newtons.
