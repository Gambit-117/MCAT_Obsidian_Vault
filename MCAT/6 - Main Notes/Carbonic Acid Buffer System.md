# carbonic acid buffer system

The carbonic acid buffering system is perhaps one of the most critical blood buffering systems that exist. Carbon dioxide, produced during metabolic cycles such as the [[TCA cycle]], can combine with water to form carbonic acid, which can disassociate into bicarbonate and free hydrogen ions or back to carbon dioxide and water, depending on the pH of the blood.
