# Gravitational Force

The gravitational force of a large mass on another mass in close proximity can be measured using the following equation:

$$ F_{g} = \frac{GM_{1}m_{2}}{r^2} $$
where G represents the universal gravitational constant:
$$ G = 6.674 * 10^{-11} N\cdot m^2/kg^2 $$
and M1 and M2 are the masses are the mass of each body in kg and r the distance between their centers.


This can be simplified when considering the force on an object near the surface of the earth in the context of Newton's second law:
$$ F_{g} = mg $$
where *g* represents the acceleration due to gravity.
