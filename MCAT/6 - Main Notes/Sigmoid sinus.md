# Sigmoid sinus

The sigmoid sinus is a paired, S-shaped venous sinus located at the base of the skull. It is a continuation of the transverse sinus, and it drains into the internal jugular vein.

It lies in a groove in the mastoid process of the temporal bone and extends from the transverse sinus to the jugular foramen.
