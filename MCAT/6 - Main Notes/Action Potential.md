# Action Potential

An action potential is a brief electrical signal that occurs when a cell's membrane potential rapidly changes. Action potentials are a type of signal that neurons and muscle cells use to communicate, as well as communication between sensory neurons and interneurons. 

In order to cause muscle contraction, the action potential will trigger the release of acetylcholine, initiating a depolarization that spreads through the muscle cell, releasing calcium ions, which triggers the actin/myosin filament model to contract.

The action potential is propagated by these steps:
- Depolarization (voltage increases) - Na+ channels open --> Na+ rushes in, making the inside more positive.
- Repolarization (voltage decreases) - Na+ channels are blocked by inactivation gate, K+ channels open --> K+ leaves, bringing the voltage down.
- Hyperpolarization (voltage overshoots) - K+ keeps leaving, making the inside even more negative and contributing to the absolute refractory period.
- Return to resting membrane potential - Sodium potassium pumps return the neuron to RMP.

The inactivation gate of the Na+ channel prevents backflow of action potentials and is responsible for the absolute refractory period in which no action potentials are possible because Na+ channels are inactivated.
