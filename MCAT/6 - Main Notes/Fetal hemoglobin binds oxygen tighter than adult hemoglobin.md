# Fetal hemoglobin binds oxygen tighter than adult hemoglobin

Research demonstrates that fetal hemoglobin is more effective at holding onto oxygen than adult hemoglobin is. This means that a higher percentage of hemoglobin holds on to oxygen as it passes through the entirety of the infant's body, and less oxygen is delivered to tissues. This may not be an issue, considering the small size of the infant and the continual supply of oxygen from the mother. 

The greater affinity of infant hemoglobin to oxygen is necessary to remove oxygen from the mother's hemoglobin.
