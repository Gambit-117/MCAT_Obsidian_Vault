# Brainstem

The brainstem is a section of the brain that connects the brain and the spinal cord. It sits at the bottom of the brain, and it includes three very critical structures; the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It functions to send messages to the rest of the body to regulate balance, breathing, heart rate, and more.

The sulcus limitans is an important reference point within the brainstem. It is the separation point between the sensory and motor cranial nerves.

The thalamus rests directly above the brainstem, with the midbrain being continuous witht he thalamus.
