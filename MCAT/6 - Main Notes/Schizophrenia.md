# Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a disorder of psychosis in which the person's thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors are out of contact with reality. 

Schizophrenic patients can experience positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include the addition of things which don't belong, such as hallucinations, hearing voices, and delusions. Negative symptoms include the loss of normal function, such as alogia, apathy, and social withdrawal.

The neurotransmitter hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that increased brain levels of dopamine are linked to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Excess dopamine can lead to overstimulation of dopamine receptors, contributing to psychotic experiences.
