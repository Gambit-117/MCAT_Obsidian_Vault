# NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid)

NMDA is one of the two major ionotropic receptors for glutamate in glutamatergic neurons. It functions to allow calcium ions into the cell once enough of a voltage change has happened.

NMDA is unique because it has a magnesium ion block within the pore of the channel which prevents ions from flowing until enough of a voltage change occurs to remove the block.

NMDA is hypothesized to be a major factor in long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. When glutamatergic neurons are stimulated and AMPA lets in sodium ions, the nerve continues to depolarize frequently and strongly enough to open the NMDA channels, allowing calcium in which acts as a secondary messenger and causing LTP.
