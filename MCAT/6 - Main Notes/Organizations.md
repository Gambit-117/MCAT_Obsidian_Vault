# Organizations

Organizations are a collection of individuals joining together to coordinate their interactions toward a specific purpose. A formal organization has its own set of distinct characteristics, including well-defined rules and regulations, a structure, and determined objectives and policies.

Types of formal organizations include a bureaucracy, a normative org, a utilitarian org, and a coercive org.
