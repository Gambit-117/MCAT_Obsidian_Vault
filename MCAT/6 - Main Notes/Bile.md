# Bile

Bile is a critical part of the digestive system which is made up of water, cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Bile is released by the liver and stored in the gallbladder until needed during digestion.

Bile mainly functions to break down fats and carry away waste. It has also been shown to help remove worn-out red blood cells and toxins from the body.
