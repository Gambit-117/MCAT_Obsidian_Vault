# Signal detection theory

Signal detection theory states that the detection of a stimulus depends both on the intensity of the stimulus and the physical/psychological state of the individual.

Basically, we notice things based on how strong they are and on how much we're paying attention.

Consider how I might hear the little beeps during the Army hearing test because I'm really listening for them, or how I can't miss a gunshot because it's way too loud. I might however tune out the fridge noises in my room at college when I'm laying in bed at night and falling asleep.
