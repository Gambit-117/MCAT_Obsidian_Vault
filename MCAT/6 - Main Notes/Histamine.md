# Histamine

Histamine is an organic compound that plays a crucial role in the immune system and other physiological processes. Histamine acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and the spinal cord, regulating sleep, appetite and mood.

Histamine is derived from the amino acid histidine. As a neurotransmitter, it is loaded into synaptic vesicles by VMAT. Once in the synaptic cleft, it is cleared out and broken down by histamine methyltransferase and MAO.

There are some metabotropic receptors that are characterized for histamine.
