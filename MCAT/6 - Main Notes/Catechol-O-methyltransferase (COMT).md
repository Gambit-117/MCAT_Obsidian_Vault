# Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)

COMT is an enzyme that breaks down catecholamines, which are chemical messengers in the brain. COMT is important for regulating hormone levels and neurotransmitters, which helps transmit signals between nerve cells.

COMT is used to metabolize dopamine, epinephrine, and norepi. It can also metabolize drugs used to treat hypertension, asthma, and Parkinson's disease.
