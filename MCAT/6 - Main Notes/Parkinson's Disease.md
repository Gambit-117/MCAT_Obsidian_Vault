# Parkinson's Disease


Parkinson's disease is primarily characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons within the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is a group of brain structures involved in motor control, and the loss of these neurons leads to a deficiency of dopamine, which is necessary for regulating movement.

Symptoms of Parkinson's disease include bradykinesia, memory deficits, and muscle tremors.
