# Basilar artery

The basilar artery is the major blood vessel located at the back of the brain that is formed by the merging of the two vertebral arteries at the level of the pons. The basilar artery runs upwards through the brainstem and divides into two posterior cerebral arteries at the level of the interpeduncular cistern.

The basilar artery supplies oxygen-rich blood to vital parts of the brain including the brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobes, and medial temporal lobes.

Of the branching arteries off of the basilar artery, the most notable are the AICA, the rest of the circle of Willis, and the vertebral arteries.
