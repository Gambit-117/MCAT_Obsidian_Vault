# Newton's Third Law of Motion

Newton's third law states for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This can be represented by the following equation:

$$ F_{a\to b} = -F_{b\to a} $$

These reactionary forces must be between the same two objects, and they must be the same kind of force.

	Ex.: Force of the earth (gravity) on a book --> the force of the book back on the earth.
