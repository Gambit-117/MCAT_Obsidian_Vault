# Nodes of Ranvier

Nodes of Ranvier are the short (1 micrometer), specialized regions in the axonal membrane that are located between each myelin sheath.

The nodes of Ranvier help propagate nerve signals by having concentrations of sodium pumps and some potassium pumps, helping propel saltatory conduction by depolarizing the nerve. They are essential for the speed and timing of nerve impulses.
