# Subcultures and countercultures

Subcultures are cultures which are shared by a smaller group of people who are also a part of a larger culture, but have special attributes which set them apart.

Countercultures are a group of members who adopt cultural patterns in opposite to larger culture. They often obtain their information from sources that are non-mainstream.
