# Axon

The axon is the segment of the neuron in which an action potential is generated and potentiated. 

The axon branches off of the soma and ends with multiple synapses that allow connections to other neurons.

In order to propagate signals faster, an axon can be wrapped in myelin sheaths. In the CNS, this is accomplished by oligodendrocytes, and in the PNS this is accomplished by Schwann cells.
