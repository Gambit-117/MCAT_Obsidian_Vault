# Class consciousness

Class consciousness is the awareness of one's place in a system of social classes, especially (in Marxist terms) as it relates to class struggle. It is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially, and politically. 

Consider how when I, as a student and aspiring doctor, recognize that systemic barriers exist for people in lower socioeconomic classes, such as the inability to afford MCAT prep courses or tutoring, and advocate for policies to reduce these inequalities.
