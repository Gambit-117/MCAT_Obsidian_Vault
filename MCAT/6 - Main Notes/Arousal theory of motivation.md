# Arousal theory of motivation

Arousal is a physiological and psychological tension that can influence motivation. The way we behave is often directed to maintain the optimum levels of arousal, and we complete tasks in order to relieve or create some of that tension.

The arousal theory of motivation states that individuals are motivated to relieve low levels of arousal driven by a craving. According to the theory, when individuals experience low levels of arousal, they are motivated to engage in activities or behaviors that can increase their arousal to reach the optimal level.
