# Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Maslow's Hierarchy of needs is based on the premise that humans are motivated by needs that are hierarchically ranked. There are some needs that are basic to all human beings, and in their absence, nothing else matters. After satisfying these basic needs, they no longer serve as motivators, and we begin to satisfy higher-order needs
