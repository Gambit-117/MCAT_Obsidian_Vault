# Aldosterone

Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that helps regulate the body's water and salt balance as well as blood pressure. It is also known to help maintain the body's acid-base balance.

In the signaling cascade in the kidney, aldosterone is released after angiotensin II. When aldosterone is released, it causes a slow action as it increases the number of sodium / potassium pumps into the distal convoluted tubule, which will cause water to leave the nephron without changing the salt levels in the blood.
