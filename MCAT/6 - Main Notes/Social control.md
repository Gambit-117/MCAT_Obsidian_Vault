# Social control

Social control is the enforcement of conformity by society upon its members, either by law or by social pressure. Social control can be broken up into formal and informal social control. 

Formal social control would be generally state-determined, external sanctions enforced by the government through the creation of laws and their enforcement, to prevent the establishment of chaos or anomie in a society. 

Informal means refer to the reactions of individuals and groups that bring about conformity to norms and laws.
