# Top-down processing

Top-down processing refers to how we use models, ideas, and expectations to interpret sensory information.

Consider, if you saw a deer standing partly behind a tree, we know that there is the rest of the deer still hiding behind the tree because we have the idea or model of a deer in our head already.
