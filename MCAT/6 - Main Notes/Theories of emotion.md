# Theories of emotion

Many different theories of emotion have been postulated. The most notable are as follows:

[[James-Lang Theory of Emotion]]

[[Canon-Bard Theory of Emotion]]

[[Schacter-Singer Theory of Emotion]]

Most notably, emotion **does not** occur before a physiological change is induced. All theories of emotion state that a change in physiology after a stimulus must come before an emotion is recognized or felt.
