# Stroke

A stroke is the sudden appearance of a limited neurological deficit with stereotyped syndromes that can suggest the site of the vascular lesion. This occurs when the blood flow to the brain is blocked, causing brain cells to die. 

Two major types of stroke are categorized: 
- Ischemic stroke (87%) - most commonly caused by a blood clot has traveled to and blocked an artery in the brain
- Hemorrhagic stroke (13%) - occurs when a blood vessel in the brain physically ruptures, causing a brain bleed

Within the ischemic stroke, two forms are categorized:
- Thrombotic stroke - occurs when a blood clot forms within an artery in the brain, blocking flow to that area
- Embolic stroke - occurs when a blood clot (embolus) travels from another part of the body to the brain, blocking a blood vessel
