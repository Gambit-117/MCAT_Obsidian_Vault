# Sodium potassium pump

The sodium potassium pump, also known as the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, is one of the most critical enzymes in the neuron, which is responsible for moving sodium and potassium against their concentration gradient. Because this is an active transport, it requires ATP.

The movement is 3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in.

The separation of charges created by the sodium potassium pump creates an electrical potential difference within the neuron, which maintains the neurons resting membrane potential. It is responsible for maintaining the Nernst potential of the neuron at roughly -70 mV.
