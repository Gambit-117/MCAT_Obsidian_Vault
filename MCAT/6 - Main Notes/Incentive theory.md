# Incentive theory

Incentive theory is a theory that states individuals are motivated to do things which they enjoy. Incentive theory focuses on the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators that drive human behavior. It claims that individuals are moved to act by a combination of both internal desires and external stimuli.

Incentive theory argues that people are primarily extrinsically motivated. 

Extrinsic factors are those which come from outside us, and are not essential for life. Intrinsic factors are those which arise from inside us, and they are essential for life.

Consider how I am motivated to study for the MCAT because I really want a high score, knowing that's the best chance I have to get into John's Hopkins. That motivation is not from an intrinsic factor; it is from the extrinsic factor of admission to Hopkins.
