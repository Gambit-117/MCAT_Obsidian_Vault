# Wernicke's Area

Wernicke's area is a very important region of the brain located on the left side of the temporal lobe. 

Wernicke's area is critical in the processing and understanding of written and spoken language. If Wernicke's area is damaged, a language disorder will occur that makes it very hard for a person to understand language, but they will not have any issue in speaking fluently. However, what is said will make no sense.
