# Limbic System

The limbic system is the section of the brain that categorizes the experience of an emotion as pleasant or unpleasant. It is the part of the brain that is involved in behavioral and emotional responses, especially when it comes to behaviors we need for survival, feeding, reproduction, and fight or flight. Based on this categorization, neurochemicals result in physiological changes.

The limbic system includes the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, and the hippocampus.
