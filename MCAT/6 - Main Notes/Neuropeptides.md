# Neuropeptides

Neuropeptides are large signaling molecules that are similar to neurotransmitters, but bigger and longer. They modulate longer-lasting effects on behaviors, emotions, and physiological functions, such as pain perception, appetite, and learning.

Neuropeptides can act both as neurotransmitters, hormones, and more. They are the brain's largest and most diverse class of signaling molecules.

They can be classified in 5 categories:
- Brain-gut peptides
- Opioid peptides
- Pituitary peptides
- Hypothalamic-releasing peptides
- Miscellaneous peptides
