# Master role

A master role is a role which overwhelms all other roles that a person might be fulfilling.

Consider in my life, the role of student for a time overwhelms all other roles I'm fulfilling. The role of a soldier might also be considered a master role, but it's hard to determine because both play a huge part and take a lot of my life up.
