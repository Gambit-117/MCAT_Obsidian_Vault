# Neighborhood safety and violence

Neighborhoods often house people of the same social standing and socioeconomic status. Due to residential segregation, neighborhoods have different crime rates and safety.

To control levels of neighborhood violence, formal means or informal means of social control could be taken. Formal means would be generally state-determined, through the creation of laws and their enforcement. Informal means refer to the reactions of individuals and groups that bring about conformity to norms and laws.

Social disorganization theory can help explain the high rate of crime in impoverished neighborhoods.
