# Compulsions

Compulsions are repetitive, ritualized behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in order to reduce anxiety or prevent a feared event.

Examples can include excessive hand washing or cleaning, checking and rechecking things, or doing repetitive actions.

Compulsions are a critical part of obsessive compulsive disorders, in which compulsions are carried out in order to resolve obsessions.
