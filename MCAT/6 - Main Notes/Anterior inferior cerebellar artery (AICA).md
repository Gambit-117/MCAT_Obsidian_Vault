# Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)

The AICA is a branch of the basilar artery that supplies blood to the inferior and anterior portions of the cerebellum, as well as certain structures in the brainstem. It arises from the lateral wall of the basilar artery, courses along the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and gives off several branches that supply the cerebellum, brainstem, and the inner ear.
