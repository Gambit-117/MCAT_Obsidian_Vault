# Calcitonin

Calcitonin is the hormone that helps regulate calcium levels in the body. The is produced by the thyroid gland and works to lower calcium levels when they are too high. 

This stimulates osteoblasts to build bone with the excess calcium, and it prevents bone reabsorption from osteoclasts.
