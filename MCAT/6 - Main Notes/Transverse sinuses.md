# Transverse sinuses

The transverse sinuses are two large veins located on either side of the posterior part of the brain, beneath the tentorium cerebelli. They collect and drain blood from the brain's superficial structures, including the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes. They transport blood to the sigmoid sinuses, which then empty into the internal jugular veins. 

They are branched off from the confluence of sinuses, and they run along the groove of the transverse sinus on the inner surface of the occipital bone.
