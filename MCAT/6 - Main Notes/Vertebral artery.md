# Vertebral artery

The vertebral artery is a set of parallel arteries that run along both sides of the brain and neck, joining into the basilar artery. They carry blood to the brain and the spinal cord, and together both vertebral arteries provide 20% of the blood flow to the brain. They have many small branching points.

Of the branching arteries, the most notable is the PICA.
