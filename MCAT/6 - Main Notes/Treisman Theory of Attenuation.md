# Treisman Theory of Attenuation

The Treisman theory states that stimuli enter the sensory register at a lower intensity, and that unattended messages will be perceived less "loudly," as if they are attenuated. Context helps reduce the threshold for recognizing stimuli. In this model, unattended messages are not eliminated, they are just weakened.
