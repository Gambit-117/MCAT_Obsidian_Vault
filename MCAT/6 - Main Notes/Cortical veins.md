# Cortical veins

The cortical veins are a part of the brain's venous system that drain the cerebrum's surface. They are located in the sub-arachnoid space and are connected by anastomotic veins. They are part of the superficial venous system, which includes the sagittal sinuses. Most cortical veins drain into the internal jugular veins.
