# Glial cells

Glial cells, also known as neuroglia, are any cells that support nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. They are the most common cells in the central nervous system.

They can modulate the rate of nerve signal propagation and synaptic action, provide a scaffold and an interface to assist in development, and they can promote or impede recovery from neural injury.
