# Culture shock

Culture shock is the personal disorientation a person experiences when faced with an unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a visit to a new country. There are four phases to culture shock:

1. Honeymoon phase - differences between the old and new cultures are seen in a romantic light
2. Negotiation phase - differences between the old and new cultures become apparent and may create anxiety
3. Adjustment phase - one grows accustomed to a new culture and develops routines
4. Mastery - assignees are able to participate fully and comfortably in the host culture
	1. Note, this does not necessarily imply assimilation.

Culture shock can also lead to biculturalism.
