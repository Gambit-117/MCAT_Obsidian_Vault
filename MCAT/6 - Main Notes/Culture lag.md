# Culture lag

Cultural lag refers to the notion that culture takes time to catch up with the technological innovations of its time, resulting in social problems. For example, AI can now diagnose diseases faster than doctors in some cases, but there are ethical and legal difficulties with liability and patient rights in medicine relating to AI.
