Evolution refers simply to the change in the characteristics of a species through generations. Sociocultural evolution is the cultural revolution and social evolution theories that examine how cultures and societies develop over time.

Selective pressures are any causes which reduce reproductive success in a portion of a population. This can be applied to non-genetic factors as well, such as ideas, norms, beliefs, and ideas.
