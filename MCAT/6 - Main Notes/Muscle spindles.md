# Muscle spindles

Muscle spindles are self-receptors located in muscle tissue that provide information about the position of limbs and other body parts in free space. Muscle spindles are able to detect changes in muscle length to give details about muscle stretching.

Muscle spindles consist of 4 to 8 special intrafusal muscle fibers surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. The fibers are arranged in a parallel arrangement with the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle. The extrafusal fibers are the force-producing fibers.

Sensory afferents are coiled around this intrafusal spiral. Primary endings arise from the largest myelinated axons (group Ia afferents) and have rapidly adapting responses, transmitting information about limb dynamics. Secondary endings (group II afferents) produce sustained responses to constant muscle length, providing information about static limb position.
