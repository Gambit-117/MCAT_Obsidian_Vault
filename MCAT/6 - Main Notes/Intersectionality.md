# Intersectionality

Intersectionality is the phenomenon where all individuals have multiple aspects of identity which overlap, and simultaneously experience some privileges due to their socially valued identity statuses and disadvantages due to their devalued identity statuses. 

Some social categories that might overlap are race, gender, class, ability, and more.

Consider how I am involved both in biomedical science and computer science. This overlap gives me a unique advantage in areas like bioinformatics, medical technology, or cybersecurity in healthcare. However, it could also mean that I sometimes struggle to fit into traditional academic or professional paths that focus on just one of these disciplines.
