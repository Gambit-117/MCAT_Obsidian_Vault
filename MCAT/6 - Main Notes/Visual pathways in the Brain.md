# Visual pathways in the Brain

The visual pathway is the route in which vision is processed and identified. Light enters the eye, stimulating photoreceptors in the retina, which sends signals to the brain through the optic nerve to the optic chiasma, to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, and finally to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe.
