# Information-processing model

The information processing model is the idea that humans actually process the information that they receive, and they don't just blindly respond to stimuli. This theory addresses how, as children grow, their brains mature and respond to stimuli more appropriately.

The information processing model relies on the three major types of memory, sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory.
