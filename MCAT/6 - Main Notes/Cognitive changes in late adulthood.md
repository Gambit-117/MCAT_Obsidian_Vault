# Cognitive changes in late adulthood

As people age, their cognitive function and memory tend to decline in certain areas. Most notably, working memory begins to be impacted, but long-term memory is not. As people age, their episodic memory, emotional memory, and source memory tend to decline, whereas semantic memory and procedural memory remain stable.

Common diseases that cause mental decline are Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
