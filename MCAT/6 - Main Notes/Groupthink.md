# Groupthink

Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within groups of people when the desire for harmony in a decision-making group overrides a realistic appraisal of alternatives. 

Groups tend to form around a single idea. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints.

Consider the various Christian denominations.
