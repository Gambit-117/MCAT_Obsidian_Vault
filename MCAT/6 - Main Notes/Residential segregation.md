# Residential segregation

Residential segregation is the separation of different groups in society in neighborhoods. It is an example of social inequality on the local scale. Segregation itself is the practice in society of separating groups of people, such as on the basis of race, religion, or ethnicity.

Residential segregation can occur in both an organized way, such as in gated communities (Veggie Tales!) and an unorganized way, such as the natural economic favoring or unfavoring of some groups to certain parts of a neighborhood or residential area.
