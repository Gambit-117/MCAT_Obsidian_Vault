# Standard Kinematic Equations

There are four standard kinematic equations that allow the relations of initial and final velocity, acceleration, time, and change in position. They are as follows:

$$v_{f} = v_{0} + a\Delta t $$
$$v^2_{f} = v^2_{0} + 2a\Delta x $$
$$ \Delta x = v_{0}\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(\Delta t)^2 $$
$$ \Delta x = (\frac{v_{f} + v_{0}}{2})t $$
These can only work if the acceleration is kept constant. If acceleration is not constant, velocity can be found by using the kinetic energy equation:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
