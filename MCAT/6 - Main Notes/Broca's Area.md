# Broca's Area

Broca's area is a very important region in the brain's frontal lobe, located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere, usually the left. 

Broca's area is responsible for speech production, grammatical processing, gesture production, and interpreting actions. Damage to Broca's area (Broca's Aphasia) will cause difficulty in forming words and producing speech, but not a struggle with comprehension.
