# Parvocellular neurons

Parvocellular neurons are small cells in the brain and the retina that process color and fine details. They are part of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway, and they contribute to high-resolution vision. They are located within the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus.
