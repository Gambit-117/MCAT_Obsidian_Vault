# Septum Pellucidum

The septum pellucidum is a thin, triangular, vertical double membrane separating the anterior horns of the left and right ventricles of the brain. It is situated between the two cerebral hemispheres. It runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum down to the fornix. It consists of both white and grey matter. The exact function of the septum pellucidum is not fully understood. 

As stated, the SP is a membrane that separates the right and left lateral ventricles. It is involved in limbic system functions, playing a role in emotions, memory, and communication between brain structures.

Think of it as a "privacy divider" in the brain between the hemispheres.
