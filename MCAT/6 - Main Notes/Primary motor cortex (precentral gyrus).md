# Primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus)

The precentral gyrus is a part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. It is located in the frontal lobe, on the lateral surface of each cerebral hemisphere.

The precentral gyrus is where several motor pathways originate, including the corticospinal tract, corticobulbar tract, and cortico-rubrospinal tract.

Tumors in or damage to the precentral gyrus will cause motor related issues such as muscle weakness.
