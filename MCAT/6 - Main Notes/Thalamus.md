# Thalamus

The thalamus, within the diencephalon, is a sensory and motor relay center to the amygdala and higher cortical regions. It helps with the sorting of neurochemicals to the correct destinations in all senses except smell. The thalamus is mostly made up of gray matter.

The thalamus is composed of different nuclei that each serve a unique role from relaying sensory and motor signals to regulation of consciousness and alertness. Most notably within the thalamus are the lateral and medial geniculate nucleus, which are responsible for the processing of sight and hearing.

The thalamic nuclei are organized into location groups: the anterior group, the lateral group, and the medial group. These groups are demarcated by the internal medullary lamina. The lateral aspect of each thalamus is enveloped by the thalamic reticular nucleus.

The two separate thalamic structures are held together at the interthalamic adhesion.
