# Internal carotid artery

The internal carotid artery is a major blood vessel that originates at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery in the neck and travels through the carotid canal in the skull. it provides the blood supply to structures in the brain including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.

It is important to mention that the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery is the only artery in the body that is surrounded completely by venous blood.
